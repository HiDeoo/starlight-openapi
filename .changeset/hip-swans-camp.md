Adds a new [`sidebar.operations.sort`](https://starlight-openapi.vercel.app/configuration/#sort) configuration option to configure the sorting method for the operation sidebar links.

The current behavior to sort the operation sidebar links in the order they appear in the OpenAPI document is preserved by default. Setting this option to `'alphabetical'` will sort the operation sidebar links alphabetically.
